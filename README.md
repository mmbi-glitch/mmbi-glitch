### Welcome to my Github Page!  

I am a fresh computer science graduate from Massey University, with experience in a wide range of fields, including networking and cybersecurity, software engineering, machine learning and data analysis, games programming, and web development. 

I am also a keen and curious cybersecurity enthusiast aspiring to break into the ever-evolving fields of networking and cybersecurity. What motivates me most about cybersecurity isn't that it's well paid or a highly respected field, it's the fact that this work helps make a safer, more secure digital world for all!

🛡️ "Safety first, security always" 🔐

## 📒 Personal Notes

- ⛱️ Hobbies: In my spare time, I enjoy participating in CTFs, playing games, reading, listening to nasheeds, caring for stray cats, and spending time in nature.

- ⚡ Fun Facts: My favorite animal is owls because they're super cool. I was born in Japan, lived in NZ for ~19 years, and now I'm in the UK. I was homeschooled for the most part of my early education.
