### Welcome to my Github Page!  

I am a fresh computer science graduate from Massey University, with experience in a wide range of fields, including networking and cybersecurity, software engineering, machine learning and data analysis, games programming, and web development. 

I am also a keen and curious cybersecurity enthusiast aspiring to break into the ever-evolving fields of networking and cybersecurity. What motivates me most about cybersecurity isn't that it's well paid or a highly respected field, it's the fact that this work helps make a safer, more secure digital world for all!

🛡️ "Safety first, security always" 🔐

## 📒 Personal Notes  

- ♂️ Pronouns: He/Him.

- 📈 Status: I’m currently learning about cybersecurity/cloud computing, training for professional cybersecurity certifications, and working as a part-time grader at Massey University.

- ⛱️ Hobbies: In my spare time, I enjoy participating in CTFs, playing games, reading, listening to nasheeds, caring for stray cats, and spending time in nature.

- ⚡ Fun Facts: My favorite animal is owls because they're super cool. I was born in Japan, lived in NZ for ~19 years, and now I'm in the UK. I was homeschooled for the most part of my early education.

- 💬 Ask Me: pretty much anything, as long as it's not too personal! For example, my distance learning experience, my passion for Islamic history, etc.
